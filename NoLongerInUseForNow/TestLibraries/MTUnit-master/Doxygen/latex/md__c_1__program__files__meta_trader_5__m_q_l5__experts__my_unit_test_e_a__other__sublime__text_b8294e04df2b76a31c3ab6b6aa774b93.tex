\subsection*{Use }

{\bfseries Compile or Syntax Check} ~\newline
{\ttfamily Ctrl+B} or {\ttfamily F7} to compile and build your project. ~\newline
{\ttfamily Ctrl+\+Shift+B} and select \char`\"{}\+Syntax Check\char`\"{} to check the syntax in your project without compilation. ~\newline
This will run the Meta\+Editor in command-\/line mode and display the results in the Sublime Text console. ~\newline
When result data is captured, you can navigate to results in your project’s files with {\ttfamily F4} and {\ttfamily Shift+\+F4}. If available, the captured error message will be displayed in the status bar.

{\bfseries Syntax Highlight} ~\newline
Sublime Text will highlight your {\ttfamily .mq5} and {\ttfamily .mqh} files in a convenient way. Since M\+Q\+L5 and C/\+C++ are \char`\"{}sisters\char`\"{} languages, the highlight is very similar to C/\+C++.

{\bfseries Auto-\/\+Complete and Snippets} ~\newline
Start typing your code and Sublime Text will display the auto-\/complete options to accelerate your production. There is a bunch of common and prepocessor snippets, but you can create your own.
